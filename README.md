# MSDS692_Global-Factors-Influencing-Tertiary-Education-Enrollment
## Overview
Over the last two decades, tertiary education enrollment, on a global scale, has more than doubled, from 18.4% in 1999 to 39.2% in 2019 (WorldBank, n.d.). The transition through education levels, however, have seen a different trend as the student population decreases at every further level. Enrollment rates are highest at the primary level, gets lower at the secondary level and is lowest at tertiary level. The intention of this project is to focus on country-specific factors and how they relate to tertiary education enrollment.

The dataset for this project was obtained from World Development Indicators published by World Bank, and in cases of missing data was supplemented by data from other trusted sources. The starting dataset comprised 266 observations, of which 217 were individual countries and 49 were aggregates based on World Bank classififcation, and 59 attributes. The focus of this project, tertiary education enrollment, was selected as the dependent target variable. By exploring relationships among factors including literacy rates, employment information, and access to utilities, we can not only discover how they affect tertiary education enrollment, but also learn areas to address in an effort to encourage enrollment.

To demonstrate correlated global factors, supervised learning and visualization were applied, as well as regression modeling since the target is numeric.
